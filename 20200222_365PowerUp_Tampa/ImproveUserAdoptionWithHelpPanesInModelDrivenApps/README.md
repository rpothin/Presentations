# Demonstration video
You can watch a video with the different demonstrations I have shown during my session at the event following [**this link**](https://youtu.be/HSXHwQzDY4o).

# Complementary notes
- The Help Panes are still in preview version, and the production version should go live in April 2020.
- For now, you can not edit help panes in out of the box applications (ex: Sales Hub). I have eard that this is a bug, and that it should
be corrected in the production version of this feature.

# How to use the solution components
**Warning: This solution is not production ready, so do not use it on a production environment.**
- "HelpPanesDemo_1_0.zip" (in the "SolutionComponents" folder) is the solution we had at the beginning of the presentation with a model driven app and an help pane on the main form of the Opportunity entity
- "HelpPanesDemo_1_1.zip" (in the "SolutionComponents" folder) is the solution we deployed on our target environment, with an additional help pane on the main form of the Lead entity, and another one on the dashboard page
- To be able to use the help panes after the import of the solution, do not forget to to [enable this specific help mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/data-platform/create-custom-help-pages#enable-custom-help-panes-for-your-environment) in the settings.
- In the Lead Help Page you will have to change the image and the video because the links I used are not public, so you will not be able to access it

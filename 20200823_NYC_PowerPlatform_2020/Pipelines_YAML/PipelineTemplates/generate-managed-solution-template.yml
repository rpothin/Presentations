# Pipeline template for the steps to generate a manage solution from an unmanaged solution

steps:
# Get artifacts built in the previous stage with the unmanaged solution
- download: current
  artifact: dropUnmanagedSolution
    
# Install the Power Platform Build Tools
- task: PowerPlatformToolInstaller@0
  inputs:
    DefaultVersion: true

# Import the unmanaged solution to the build environment
- task: PowerPlatformImportSolution@0
  inputs:
    authenticationType: 'PowerPlatformSPN'
    PowerPlatformSPN: 'Build'
    SolutionInputFile: '$(Pipeline.Workspace)\dropUnmanagedSolution\$(SolutionName).zip'
    AsyncOperation: true
    MaxAsyncWaitTime: '240'

# Export the considered solution as managed
- task: PowerPlatformExportSolution@0
  inputs:
    authenticationType: 'PowerPlatformSPN'
    PowerPlatformSPN: 'Build'
    SolutionName: '$(SolutionName)'
    SolutionOutputFile: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)\$(SolutionName)_managed.zip'
    Managed: true

# Publish the managed solution we got in a previous task as an artifcat so we can use it in another stage
- publish: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)\$(SolutionName)_managed.zip'
  displayName: 'Publish managed solution for later use in the pipeline'

# Apologies
For those who attended at this session at the 365 Power Up event in Tampa, I apologize for the demonstration that did not work as expected. You will be able to find videos here that will show you in action the solution I have build for the onboarding of new employees.

# How to use the solution components
**Warning: This solution is not production ready, so do not use it on a production environment.**
- Prerequisites:
  - At least a trial access to Adobe Sign
  - A trial / sandbox environment with Dynamics 365 Human Resources (formerly known as Talent - Core HR) deployed
  - At least one candidate record created
  - At least one job application record created and associated with one of the candidates above
  - A Microsoft Forms Pro survey like the one you will see in the "04 - New employee information gathering.mp4" video in the "Demonstration" folder
  
- "OnboardingDemo_1_0.zip" (in the "SolutionComponents" folder) is the core solution for this demonstration
- "Sendwelcomecardtonewemployeeonfirstday_20200229155252.zip" and "GetOnboardingFeedbacks_20200229155424.zip" (in the "SolutionComponents" folder) contains flows that can be executed manually from a Worker Onboarding record in the model-driven app in the solution
- "OnboardingWithThePowerPlatform_Report.pbix" (in the "SolutionComponents" folder) is the Power BI report you can see in the "08 - Power BI report on Onboarding.mp4" video in the "Demonstration" folder

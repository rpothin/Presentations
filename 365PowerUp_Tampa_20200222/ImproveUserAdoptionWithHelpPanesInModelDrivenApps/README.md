# Complementary notes
- The Help Panes are still in preview version, and the production version should go live in April.
- For now, you can not edit help panes in out of the box applications (ex: Sales Hub). I have eard that this is a bug that should
be corrected in the production version of this feature.

# How to use the solution
**This solution is not production ready. Do not use it on a production environment.**
- Import the solution on the environment if you want to try it. It is the solution we had at the end of the demonstration with an Help Pane on the main form of the Lead entity, and another one on the main form of the Opportunity entity. The image and the video in the Help Pane on the Lead form will not work on your environment because they are not based on public links.
- To be able to use the help panes after the import of the solution, do not forget to to enable this Help mode in the settings.

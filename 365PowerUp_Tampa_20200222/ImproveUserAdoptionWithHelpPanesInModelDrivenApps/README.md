# Complementary notes
- The Help Panes are still in preview version, and the production version should go live in April 2020.
- For now, you can not edit help panes in out of the box applications (ex: Sales Hub). I have eard that this is a bug, and that it should
be corrected in the production version of this feature.

# How to use the solutions
**Warning: This solution is not production ready, so do not use it on a production environment.**
- HelpPanesDemo_1_0.zip is the solution we had at the beginning of the presentation with a model driven app and an help pane on the main form of the Opportunity entity
- HelpPanesDemo_1_1.zip is the solution we deployed on our target environment, with an additional help pane on the main form of the Lead entity
- To be able to use the help panes after the import of the solution, do not forget to to enable this specific help mode in the settings.
- In the Lead Help Page you will have to change the image and the video because the links I used are not public, so you will not be able to access it
